### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a diligent and open-minded physicist, currently doing my PhD in particle physics ðŸ”¬

I am keen on programming with a focus on:
- Python (backend web, ML/Data science, scripting)
- C/C++ (microcontrollers, simulation, scripting)

I am a fast learner and self-motivated person, interested in new technologies and development techniques. I am passionate about learning something new and self-development both in professional and personal areas ðŸ“–ðŸ§˜
